# How to use roli-trade-ad-automation

This quick guide walks through verifying your Roblox account and posting trade ads using the GUI.

## 1. Verify your Roblox account

Before posting, verify your Roblox profile contains a generated verification code.

1. Open the app and click "Login" (if not already logged in).
2. Generate a verification code from the app.

- Go to your Roblox profile > About section and paste the generated verification code there.
- Wait a few moments for Roblox to save the description, then click "Verify" in the app.

## 2. Load your inventory

Once verified, enter your Player ID (or use the logged-in account). The app will load your inventory and enrich each instance with catalog metadata.

Notes:
- Inventory is refreshed automatically every 20 minutes.
- Use the "Refresh Inventory" button to force a reload.

## 3. Build an ad (Offer & Request)

- Offer: select up to 4 items from your inventory.
- Request: select up to 4 catalog items or tags describing what you want.

Tips:
- Use the search box to find catalog items by name or abbreviation.
- Tags (e.g., ANY, DEMAND) count toward the 4-request limit.

## 4. Save and run ads

- Click "Save as ad" to persist the current offer/request as a reusable ad.
- Open the Ads manager to view saved ads, set a global posting interval (minimum 15 minutes), and start/stop runners.

Important:
- When using a global interval, per-ad interval badges are hidden to reduce clutter.
- The app prevents intervals shorter than 15 minutes at both client and backend.
