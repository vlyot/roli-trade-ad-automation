before making changes, read through the codebase to understand how it works.
when creating a new file, add a comment at the top with a brief description of its feature/purpose.

When making changes to existing files, ensure that your modifications align with the overall architecture and coding style of the project.
When adding new features, integrate them such that the code uses as little resources as possible. (prioritise rust over typescript or frontend logic)
